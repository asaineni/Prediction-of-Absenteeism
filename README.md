# Prediction-of-Absenteeism

This project applies multiple machine learning algorithms and determine the effective algorithm that best predicts the Absenteeism at work in hours. Prior to Prediction, Correlation between variables, Preparing the Data and Data Exploration is performed. Some of the Machine Learning Models used are Tree Based classification, Random forest, Regression Tree, Na√Øve Bayes Model, Support Vector Methods (Vanilla, poly and rbf) and K-Nearest Neighbor.
